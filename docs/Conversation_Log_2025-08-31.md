## 2025-08-31 12:55
- Rephrased question:
  - Timeline tab not visible; ensure program auto-starts the 127.0.0.1 page; add a UI option to toggle auto-open (default on); proceed all at once and keep records updated.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Restored a single-row Settings UI and added back the '時間線 / Timeline' tab with 10 fields (UI_TIMELINE_*, PATH_MAPPINGS, EMBEDDED SERVER settings). Set OPEN_TIMELINE_ON_START default=True so main program auto-opens the timeline page. Kept Tkinter stability fixes. Will continue to log each change.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - Embedded server starts in background; on start, browser auto-opens if OPEN_TIMELINE_ON_START=True.
- Next actions:
  - Verify UI shows the Timeline tab and that the browser opens on start; then refine timeline UI as planned.

## 2025-08-31 11:45
- Rephrased question:
  - Implement 1+2+3: full filters UI (tri-state, presets, types), grouping by base_key, and styling; also add a living handover/progress tracker document.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Enhanced /ui/timeline with filter form (tri-state selects, date inputs, type checkboxes), grouping option, summary with chips and Top authors, basic styling; added docs/Handover_Progress_Tracker.md as a living tracker of work done/in progress/next steps.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - Keep minimal dependencies; all styling inline; improve progressively.
- Next actions:
  - Optionally add JS or server logic to merge checkbox types; preserve query fully on pagination; improve event details rendering.

## 2025-08-31 11:32
- Rephrased question:
  - Ensure the Git/Timeline features are integrated into the existing watchdog app without relying on .bat, and run as part of the monitoring tool.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Added in-process background Flask server startup in main.py with settings to control it (ENABLE_TIMELINE_SERVER, HOST/PORT, OPEN_TIMELINE_ON_START). Timeline runs inside the app; no separate .bat required. Settings UI updated accordingly.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - Keep server debug=False and use_reloader=False; start as daemon thread; print URL; optionally auto-open browser.
- Next actions:
  - You can run the main app as usual; timeline will be available at the configured URL. I can now proceed to refine /ui/timeline filters and grouping.

## 2025-08-31 11:20
- Rephrased question:
  - Do 1+2+3: add tri-state UI defaults, implement /ui/timeline routes and pages, and add PATH_MAPPINGS parsing helper.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Added PATH_MAPPINGS parser and map_path_for_display helper; introduced /ui/timeline, /ui/timeline/event/<id>, /ui/timeline/diff/<id> routes in git_viewer.py (MVP list, summary bar, pagination, and diff); created events_db helpers to fetch event by id and neighbor event. Timeline settings tab added in settings UI.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - MVP HTML minimal; will iterate styling later. Tri-state inputs for has_snapshot/has_summary are read from query string using defaults from settings.
- Next actions:
  - If OK, proceed to refine filters UI (tri-state controls) and wire grouping-by-base_key in rendering as optional.

## 2025-08-31 11:08
- Rephrased question:
  - No special test needed from you for M1; proceed directly to M2 (settings + UI persistence and grey help text).
- Assistant response summary:
  - Reviewed settings/runtime/UI architecture; added new timeline-related settings in config/settings.py; added a new Timeline tab and fields in ui/settings_ui.py with help text; kept runtime.apply to coerce types.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - Timeline defaults: days=7, page size=50 (max 200), warn days 180, group-by toggle false by default, default has_snapshot yes, has_summary ignore, min_total 1, sort desc.
- Next actions:
  - Wire any remaining settings into the UI if missing; then proceed to M3 implementing /ui/timeline routes.

## 2025-08-31 11:00
- Rephrased question:
  - Confirm M1 implementation status and choose next step (M2 settings/UI or M3 routes), while continuing to append every reply to the Conversation Log.
- Assistant response summary:
  - M1 completed: added DB query helpers and aggregates; added counters + event insertion; integrated into comparison flow post-snapshot. Wireframe updated to /ui/timeline. Conversation log continues to be updated per reply.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - Ready to proceed with M2 (settings + UI persistence) or M3 (/ui/timeline routes + basic pages) based on user's preference.
- Next actions:
  - Await user's choice; then implement and add a fresh log entry upon completion.

## 2025-08-31 10:52
- Rephrased question:
  - Confirm M1 progress and ask what to do next; keep appending each reply to the Conversation_Log.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Implemented M1 (DB helpers + counters + event insertion). Ready to proceed with either M2 (settings + UI) or M3 (/ui/timeline routes and basic pages). Will keep logging every reply.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - Proceed next with either settings (tri-state defaults etc.) or UI routes, per user's choice.
- Next actions:
  - On approval, start the selected module and add another log entry upon completion.

## 2025-08-31 10:45
- Rephrased question:
  - Proceed with M1: implement SQLite query helpers and history counters/inserts, and integrate event insertion after snapshot save.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Added high-level query helpers to utils/events_db.py: _build_where_clause and query_events (filters, pagination, totals, sums, top authors). Kept query_events_by_base_key for compatibility.
  - Added compute_change_counters and insert_event_index to utils/history.py to compute dvc/fci/xrlc/xru/addc/delc/total_changes and insert into SQLite with file stats.
  - Integrated insert_event_index into core/comparison.py after saving snapshot and Git JSON (if available).
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - Counters follow Compare_Logic design; INDIRECT/NO_CHANGE not counted in specific buckets but included in total.
  - Event_time uses datetime.now().isoformat(); file_path stored as absolute path.
- Next actions:
  - M2: add settings keys and settings UI (tri-state defaults, page size, warn days, global toggle, grouping, path mappings).
  - M3: implement Flask routes /ui/timeline, /ui/timeline/event/<id>, /ui/timeline/diff/<id> and basic templates.

## 2025-08-31 10:32
- Rephrased question:
  - Confirm wireframe choices: use prefix /ui/timeline, keep tri-state checkboxes, default page size 50, show Top authors, base_key default visible, accept COUNT(*) for totals, render summary JSON inline, meaningful=1 default, 1000-row cap for diff, 180-day warning, max page size 200; and additional decisions: provide a global toggle to hide indirect internal changes in diff, allow grouping by base_key, store absolute paths and implement a path mapping layer first, Traditional Chinese as primary UI language; also log every reply to the Conversation_Log (reverse chronological), and may ask for later summaries.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Acknowledged and updated wireframe to use /ui/timeline; will implement SQLite query helpers and history counters/inserts; add /ui/timeline routes; add settings for IGNORE_INDIRECT_CHANGES (global), GROUP_BY_BASEKEY (UI behavior), and PATH_MAPPING layer (configurable); ensure conversation logging per reply.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - /ui/timeline prefix; base_key shown by default; tri-state filters; totals via COUNT(*); render summary JSON inline; defaults as specified; Traditional Chinese primary labels with English acronyms.
- Next actions:
  - Finalize wireframe references; begin implementation of DB helpers + counters; add Flask routes and settings stubs; keep logging each step.

## 2025-08-31 10:20
- Rephrased question:
  - Recall the latest working memory and continue with option 1: walk through the /timeline wireframe; also ensure each conversation is recorded in the daily conversation log.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Retrieved recent status; created docs/Timeline_Wireframe_2025-08-31.md; prepared to walk through section-by-section; and appended this entry to the log per request.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - Keep logging every Q/A into docs/Conversation_Log_2025-08-31.md (newest first).
  - Align wireframe with utils/events_db.py schema; implement /timeline under the existing Flask app (git_viewer.py) for MVP.
- Next actions:
  - Walkthrough and collect approvals or changes.
  - Implement SQLite query helpers + history summary counters and inserts.
  - Add /timeline routes and quick diff view; wire default settings.


## 2025-08-31 10:00
- Rephrased question:
  - Implement options B + C: (B) start a persistent conversation log that records each Q/A with a rephrased, record-friendly version; (C) provide a wireframe mock for the new /timeline page before coding, to confirm UI/UX.
  - Also: ensure the new settings show in the startup UI with grey help text, persist to runtime_settings.json, and remain consistent across restarts.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Will create a daily conversation log file under docs/ with timestamped entries. Starting now with this entry.
  - Will deliver a /timeline page wireframe (HTML mock and behavior notes) as a separate doc for confirmation.
  - Reconfirmed baseline now stores both formula and values (including cached_value) and outlined the plan to add SQLite timeline index and UI integration without impacting existing features.
- Decisions/Assumptions:
  - Conversation log path: docs/Conversation_Log_2025-08-31.md.
  - /timeline page will read from SQLite (LOG_FOLDER/events.sqlite) for performance; falls back to JSON if needed in later iterations.
- Next actions:
  - Provide wireframe doc for /timeline page (filters, summary row, list items, quick diff links, pagination/limits).
  - After approval, implement utils/history summary + SQLite inserts, and the /timeline view.

## 2025-08-31 09:50
- Rephrased question:
  - Confirm baseline now saves both formula and values; proceed with option C (SQLite event index + /timeline page) in a modular, maintainable way and expose new settings in the UI with persistent runtime overrides.
- Assistant response summary:
  - Confirmed baseline contains formula, value, and cached_value per cell; CSV persists optionally for polars.
  - Proposed modular plan: add utils/events_db.py (done), expand utils/history to compute summary and write SQLite, add /timeline to viewer, and settings + UI controls.
- Decisions:
  - SQLite path default: LOG_FOLDER/events.sqlite.
- Next actions:
  - Implement history summary + SQLite inserts; implement /timeline after wireframe approval; extend UI settings.
