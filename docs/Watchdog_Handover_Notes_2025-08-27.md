# Watchdog Handover Notes (2025-08-27)

Purpose: Capture today's findings, decisions, and recommended next actions. See also: Watchdog_Project_Summary_2025-08-27.md.

Summary of today's findings (2025-08-27)
- Codebase mapping completed with emphasis on Excel reading paths and potential file-lock risks.
- Verified there is no win32com usage; openpyxl is the primary Excel reader.
- The design already prefers operating on cached copies via utils.cache.copy_to_cache before heavy reads.
- Non-locking approach for last author retrieval (docProps/core.xml from cached .xlsx) is documented and recommended; fallback should still read the cached file to avoid touching the original.
- Watcher behavior aligns with reduced-noise goals: debounce, silent preview compare, and mtime-based adaptive polling.

Operational recommendations (no code required to adopt as practice)
1) Always read from cached copies; avoid falling back to original file if copy_to_cache fails. Instead, retry copying with small backoff and skip read when all retries fail.
2) Keep CACHE_FOLDER out of watched roots, or configure an ignore rule for it to avoid cache noise.
3) Periodic cleanup in long-running sessions: after N events/files, run gc.collect(), clear large variables, and ensure no workbook/ZipFile handles remain.
4) For external references: ensure formulas are normalized using extract_external_refs + unquote + backslash normalization in both baseline and compare phases to avoid false diffs.

What changed in docs today
- Added Watchdog_Project_Summary_2025-08-27.md with:
  - Detailed architecture map
  - End-to-end flow (monitor → compare → baseline update)
  - File-lock avoidance strategy and cleanup guidance
  - Update log and runbook checklist

Next steps (suggested)
- Decide on policy if copy_to_cache fails: (A) retry only, no fallback to original read; (B) allow fallback to original (current behavior) for resilience. Default recommendation: (A) for zero lock risk.
- Consider adding an ignore rule for CACHE_FOLDER in watcher scheduling as an optional setting.
- If external-reference heavy workbooks are common, prioritize integrating ref_map-based normalization into dump/pretty path.

Verification checklist for tomorrow
- Sample Excel with external links: baseline then modify source to trigger EXTERNAL_REF_UPDATE; confirm diff classification and aligned rendering.
- Confirm that last author is retrievable without opening the original file.
- Monitor long run: ensure adaptive polling stops when mtime stabilizes and no phantom changes are reported.
